Problem Description
Given a set of non-overlapping intervals, insert a new interval into the intervals (merge if necessary).

You may assume that the intervals were initially sorted according to their start times.

Problem Constraints
0 <= |intervals| <= 10^5
'''
# Definition for an interval.
# class Interval:
#     def __init__(self, s=0, e=0):
#         self.start = s
#         self.end = e

class Solution:
    # @param intervals, a list of Intervals
    # @param newInterval, a Interval
    # @return a list of Interval
    def insert(self, intervals, newInterval):
        pass
